# Terminal command cheatsheet
In this repo, I will gather a set of terminal command I believe is useful in daily operation and describ them as clean as possible.

## File management
### To delete a file or folder
```
rm file_name
rm -R folder_name
```
The reason to do this is sometimes you will run into permission problem when you are trying to delete some files or folders. use this command with a sudo prefix will easily fix the problem.
